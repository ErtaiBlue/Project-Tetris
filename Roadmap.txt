BASICS

Writing the report

EXTRA functionnalities:
colors through ANSI escape codes.
having an animation on the empty squares (think about carambolage)
playing music in the background by launching a process in the background.
having the window flash when the user gets to a certain score (see the flasher code somewhere in the ansi escape code search tabs)

IDEAS TO MAKE IT REAL

https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797
The keyboard strings section could be used to remap the arrow keys to a letter + enter so say the user can use either jklm or arrow keys we basically transform the arrow keys into jklm too so we can catch them with the input.

REPORT

3- Guide of installation and use
4- List of dependencies / third party library (link to the sources)
5- Code that was not written by you
6- Probably add in sources that helped us
7- Known issues and bugs
...

PRESENTATION

put inphasis on the fact that i use (almost) no librairies
1point if you add a line, 2 if you delete one! less is more!
never trust user input!


Bugs!
Unicode square that took more than one character of space which shifted all the display

sys.stdout.flush() : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10019456/usage-of-sys-stdout-flush-method
Before there was strange behaviour that i didn't understand sometimes i would tell the code to print something then sleep and it would sleep then print everything at the same time.

Against certain questions:

On a question about the generate_grid() function, why do we return a direct grid for the first values:
1		0 1 0          0 1 1 1 0            0 0 1 1 1 0 0				0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0	From then on, we only add 2 lines in the middle
		1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1            0 1 1 1 1 1 0				0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
		0 1 0		   1 1 1 1 1            1 1 1 1 1 1 1				0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
		               1 1 1 1 1            1 1 1 1 1 1 1				1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
		               0 1 1 1 0            1 1 1 1 1 1 1				1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
		               						0 1 1 1 1 1 0				1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
		               						0 0 1 1 1 0 0				0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
		               													0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
		               													0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
